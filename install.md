## 1. Prepare and get started

Make a bootable USB using a USB burner like [balenaEtcherh](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or commands like [dd](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dd_(Unix)) with an image downloaded from [archlinux wiki page](https://archlinux.org/download/).

Boot into Arch Linux with this USB plugged in your computer, you should see something like:

```
root@archiso ~ # 
```

And you are ready with a terminal to start the installation process.
